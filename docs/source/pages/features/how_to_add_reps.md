# Add your own physicsml features

The ``physicsml`` provides a basic set of features that should suffice for most models. But if you have a cool new model
that requires more sophisticated features, then you can also add those and use them via ``molflux``. See the
[docs](https://exscientia.github.io/molflux/pages/features/how_to_add_reps.html) for more info.
