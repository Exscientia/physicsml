# MolFlux

The ``physicsml`` package is built on top of ``molflux``, a foundational package for molecular predictive
modelling. ``molflux`` handles the basic standard API and provides the abstractions on top of which the ``physicsml`` package is built.

If you are not familiar with the ``molflux`` package, you can browse its [documentation](https://exscientia.github.io/molflux/index.html).
``molflux`` will be the main package you will need to use the ``physicsml`` models.
