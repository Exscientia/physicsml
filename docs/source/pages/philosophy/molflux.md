# MolFlux

The ``physicsml`` package is built on top of ``molflux``, a foundational package for molecular predictive
modelling. It handles the basic standard API and provides the abstractions on top of which the ``physicsml`` package is built.

If you are not familiar with the ``molflux`` package, have a look at its documentation (TODO: LINK). It will be the main package you will
need to use the ``physicsml`` models. The ``physicsml`` package is simply an extension of ``molflux``.
